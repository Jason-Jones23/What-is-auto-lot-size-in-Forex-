# What is auto lot size in Forex? 

Auto lot size automatically sets the trade size based on certain conditions, like account balance, risk percentage, or rules in a trading strategy. It’s commonly used in automated trading software, especially in Expert Advisors (EAs). This feature help traders manage risk by adjusting the trade size without needing to set it manually each time. 

For example, a trader might set their risk at 1% of their account balance for each trade. With auto lot sizing enabled, the trading platform will calculate the lot size that corresponds to 1% of the current account balance, adjusting for market volatility and other factors.

# How Does Auto Lot Sizing Work? 

Auto lot sizing on trading platforms helps set the trade size automatically based on risk settings, so traders can keep a consistent level of risk. It usually works by looking at factors like account balance, chosen risk percentage, and pip value. 

For example, if a trader has $10,000 and sets the risk at 2%, the system would use $200 for that trade. Another way to calculate is by combining the risk percentage with the stop-loss distance; if the stop-loss is larger, the lot size will be smaller to keep the risk at the same percentage. There’s also a pip-based method, where traders pick a dollar amount per pip, like $10 per pip, and the system adjusts the lot size based on the balance and stop-loss.
